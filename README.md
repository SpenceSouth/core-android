android-simply-advanced-helper
==============================

A collection of short helper classes that I've used in Android apps, all rolled up into a library project. This is still under development and testing.

The files in the package net.simplyadvanced.helper are better to you if want to use other third-party libraries, but this will make your project larger.

The files in the package net.simplyadvanced.helper.old are "better" if you want your project to have a small footprint, but less features.
